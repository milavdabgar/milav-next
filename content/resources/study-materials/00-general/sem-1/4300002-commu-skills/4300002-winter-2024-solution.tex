\subsection{Question 1(b) {[}4 marks{]}}\label{question-1b-4-marks}

\textbf{Answer the following questions: (Any Four)}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{How can you explain the term `communication'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Communication is the process of exchanging
  information, ideas, and feelings between individuals through a common
  system of symbols, signs, or behaviors. It involves a sender
  transmitting a message through a channel to a receiver who provides
  feedback.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What can you infer from the term `encoding'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Encoding is the process of converting thoughts and
  ideas into symbols, words, or gestures that the receiver can
  understand. It's how the sender transforms the message into a suitable
  format before transmission through the selected communication channel.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{How will you contrast `verbal communication' and `non-verbal
  communication'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}:

  attitudes \\
  \end{longtable}
  }
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{How would you summarise the term `paralanguage'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Paralanguage refers to how we say things rather than
  what we say. It includes voice qualities (pitch, tone, volume), vocal
  characterizers (laughing, crying), vocal qualifiers (intensity,
  rhythm), and vocal segregates (fillers like ``um,'' ``ah''). These
  elements add emotional context to verbal communication.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{If a listener does not know/understand a speaker's language,
  what kind of barrier will it be called?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: This is a semantic barrier or language barrier. It
  occurs when the sender and receiver use different languages,
  specialized terminology, or jargon that prevents effective
  understanding of the message's intended meaning.
\end{solutionbox}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 1(c) {[}7 marks{]}}\label{question-1c-7-marks}

\textbf{Answer the following questions: (Any Seven)}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{What must the horse find `queer'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: In ``Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,'' the
  horse finds it strange (queer) that the speaker has stopped ``without
  a farmhouse near'' in the dark woods. The horse is confused by the
  unscheduled stop in an uninhabited area, especially during a snowy
  evening.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{``He gives his harness bells a shake'' -- Who is `he'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: `He' refers to the horse in the poem. The horse
  shakes its harness bells as if questioning why they've stopped in the
  middle of nowhere, reminding the speaker of their responsibilities and
  journey ahead.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What does Tagore suggest through the phrase ``mind is without
  fear''?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Through the phrase ``mind is without fear,'' Tagore
  suggests a society where people can think and express themselves
  freely without intimidation or oppression. He envisions citizens who
  aren't afraid to voice their opinions or embrace new ideas due to
  political, social, or religious pressure.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{Whom does Tagore address as `my Father'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Tagore addresses God as `my Father' in the poem
  ``Where the Mind is Without Fear.'' This spiritual invocation shows
  Tagore seeking divine help to achieve his vision of a free,
  enlightened nation where reason and truth prevail.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What was the appointment made between Bob and Jimmy before
  twenty years?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Bob and Jimmy had made an appointment to meet at the
  same spot (outside what was Big Joe Brady's restaurant) exactly twenty
  years later at 10 PM, regardless of where life took them. This
  agreement was made over their last dinner together before parting
  ways.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{Why was Bob under arrest?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Bob was under arrest because he was a wanted criminal
  from Chicago. During their twenty years apart, while Jimmy had become
  a policeman, Bob had chosen a life of crime and had become a notorious
  criminal with a wanted status, which Jimmy had discovered during his
  police duty.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What examples of nature can you find to justify `The Leopard'
  as a nature-centric prose?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: ``The Leopard'' contains numerous nature elements:
  the mountain stream, forktail bird, ravine ecosystem, the leopard
  itself, jungle sounds, seasonal changes, and descriptions of natural
  habitats. The author's detailed observations of flora and fauna and
  their interdependence create a rich nature-centric narrative.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{Why were the shikaris roaming in the forest?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: The shikaris (hunters) were roaming in the forest to
  hunt and kill the leopard and other wild animals. This represents the
  human threat to wildlife that the author disapproves of, highlighting
  the conflict between human encroachment and wildlife preservation.
\end{solutionbox}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{OR}\label{or}

\textbf{Answer the following questions: (Any Seven)}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Which season is described in `Stopping by Woods'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Winter season is described in ``Stopping by Woods on
  a Snowy Evening.'' This is evident from descriptions of snowfall
  (``woods fill up with snow''), the ``darkest evening of the year''
  suggesting winter solstice, and the frozen lake mentioned in the poem.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{Which promises does the poet talk about in `Stopping by Woods
  on a Snowy Evening'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: The poet doesn't specify what promises he refers to
  in the line ``And miles to go before I sleep.'' These likely represent
  social obligations, responsibilities, and commitments that demand his
  attention. The repeated line emphasizes both literal journey distance
  and figurative life commitments.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What does the poet mean by ``knowledge is free''?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: By ``knowledge is free,'' Tagore envisions a society
  where education and information are accessible to everyone regardless
  of social status, caste, gender, or economic condition. He dreams of
  learning without boundaries, where ideas flow freely without
  restrictive traditions or prejudices.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What is meant by ``narrow domestic walls''?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: ``Narrow domestic walls'' refers to artificial
  divisions based on religion, caste, class, language, and region that
  separate people within a country. Tagore criticizes these artificial
  barriers that fragment society and hinder national unity and human
  connection.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{How did Bob realise that the cop was not Jimmy?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Bob realized the cop wasn't Jimmy when the
  plainclothes officer (the real policeman who arrested him) mentioned
  that Jimmy had sent him. Additionally, the plainclothes officer
  matched Jimmy's description of his friend, revealing the uniformed cop
  had been Jimmy in disguise who couldn't arrest his friend himself.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What does the phrase `guardian of peace' mean?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: The phrase ``guardian of peace'' in ``After Twenty
  Years'' refers to Jimmy Wells' role as a police officer. It highlights
  his duty to uphold law and order, protect citizens, and maintain
  social peace and safety, which ultimately conflicts with his personal
  loyalty to his friend Bob.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What was the author's attitude towards man in `The Leopard'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: In ``The Leopard,'' the author held a critical
  attitude toward humans who disturbed or harmed wildlife. He
  disapproved of hunters (shikaris), expressed concern about human
  encroachment on natural habitats, and preferred animals' company over
  humans'. He valued people who respected nature's balance.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{How was the ravine?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: The ravine in ``The Leopard'' was described as a
  deep, secluded valley with a stream running through it. It featured
  dense vegetation, rocks, and served as a natural habitat for various
  wildlife including the leopard and forktail. The author portrayed it
  as a peaceful, untouched sanctuary away from human interference.

\subsubsection{2. Facial expressions and Eye
contact}\label{facial-expressions-and-eye-contact}

\begin{solutionbox}
\textbf{Answer}: Facial expressions and eye contact are powerful forms
of non-verbal communication that often convey emotions more
authentically than words.

Micro-expressions & Brief, involuntary expressions revealing true
feelings & Often last less than 1/25 of a second \\
Eye Movement & Direction of gaze indicates thinking patterns &
Left/right movements connect to brain activity \\
\end{longtable}
}

These non-verbal cues provide critical context to verbal messages, often
revealing true feelings when words might be deceptive. Research shows
facial expressions constitute about 55\% of the emotional impact in
face-to-face communication.

\end{longtable}
}

The poet is drawn to the tranquil beauty of the snow-filled woods but
recognizes that life's responsibilities cannot be ignored indefinitely.
This represents the universal human dilemma between appreciating life's
moments of beauty and fulfilling obligations.

The decision to move on, indicated by ``miles to go before I sleep,''
shows the poet choosing duty over momentary pleasure, though the
repetition of this line suggests a lingering reluctance.

The story advocates for a deeper connection with nature through careful
observation rather than domination or exploitation. It suggests that
wild animals deserve respect and protection, not fear or hunting.

The leopard symbolizes both the majesty and vulnerability of nature,
while the author represents the potential for humans to appreciate
wildlife without harming it. This message of conservation and
coexistence remains relevant today amid environmental challenges.

\end{longtable}
}

The author's pain stems from witnessing the gradual destruction of a
natural paradise and the threat to creatures he has come to respect. His
particular concern for the leopard represents broader anxiety about
humanity's relationship with nature.

The emotional tone shifts from appreciation of beauty to fear for its
survival, creating a powerful environmental message. This concern
resonates today amid accelerating habitat loss and species extinction.

}

The story presents no easy resolution to this ethical dilemma. Jimmy
finds a compromise by arranging for another officer to make the arrest
while explaining his actions in a note, showing respect for both
friendship and duty.

O. Henry uses this conflict to explore how life choices can transform
relationships and create impossible situations where personal and
professional values collide. The story resonates because this tension
between individual connections and societal responsibilities is
universally experienced.

Natural Beauty & ``Woods fill up with snow,'' ``lovely, dark and deep''

respite from life's journey \\
Inner Conflict & Horse's questioning bell shake & Tension between desire
and duty \\
Life Journey & Repeated ``miles to go before I sleep'' & Continuing path

\end{longtable}
}

The central idea revolves around life's brief moments of contemplation
amid constant movement toward obligations. The speaker pauses to
appreciate beauty but acknowledges the impossibility of remaining in
that moment indefinitely.

The repetition of ``miles to go before I sleep'' carries dual meaning -
both the literal journey ahead and the figurative ``sleep'' of death,
suggesting the continuation of life's responsibilities until the end.
This creates a meditation on mortality, duty, and the fleeting nature of
experience.

\item
  Recipient's name and title (if known)

Subject: Complaint Regarding Staff Behavior at A.G. Road Branch

Dear Manager,

Account Number: [Your Account Number]
Visit Date: January 1, 2025
Time: Approximately 11:30 AM

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the unprofessional behavior I experienced during my recent visit to your A.G. Road Branch on January 1, 2025.

I visited the branch to update my KYC details and inquire about a home loan. While waiting for my turn at counter number 4, the staff member (with name tag "Mr. [Name]") addressed me in a dismissive tone when I asked about the documentation requirements. When I requested clarification on certain forms, he made several condescending remarks in front of other customers, stating that "everyone knows this basic information" and visibly displaying impatience.

This treatment was not only embarrassing but also contradicts the customer service standards I have come to expect from GrowRich Bank over my eight years as a loyal customer.

I request that this matter be investigated and appropriate action be taken to ensure such incidents do not recur. I would appreciate receiving:
1. An acknowledgment of this complaint
2. Information about the steps taken to address this issue
3. Assurance that bank staff receive proper training in customer interaction

I hope this matter receives your prompt attention. I can be reached at [Your Phone Number] should you need any additional information.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
Account Holder

I am writing to express my concern regarding the non-delivery of my laptop ordered from your online store ten days ago.

As per your confirmation email dated December 23, 2024, the laptop was supposed to be delivered within 7 working days, which should have been by December 30, 2024. Despite the payment being processed immediately, I have not received the product, nor has there been any communication from your end regarding the delay.

This situation has caused significant inconvenience as I urgently need this laptop for my professional work. I have made several attempts to contact your customer service at 1800-XXX-XXXX, but have been unable to receive any satisfactory response or concrete information about my order status.

I request immediate attention to this matter with the following actions:
1. Expedite the delivery of my laptop within the next 48 hours
2. Provide tracking information via email and SMS
3. Offer a reasonable compensation for the delay and inconvenience caused

If I do not receive the laptop or a satisfactory response by January 5, 2025, I will be compelled to escalate this matter to the consumer forum and seek a full refund.

I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue.

Sincerely,
