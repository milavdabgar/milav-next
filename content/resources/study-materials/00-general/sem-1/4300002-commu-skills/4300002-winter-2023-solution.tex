\begin{solutionbox}

\item
  \textbf{What is the role played by the horse in this poem?}

\begin{solutionbox}

Subject: Complaint Regarding Incomplete Delivery of Compass Boxes

Dear Sir/Madam,

Reference: Purchase Order No. SR/CB/2024/78 dated January 15, 2024

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction regarding the recent delivery of compass boxes ordered by me on January 15, 2024.

As per my purchase order, I had ordered 500 compass boxes, but the consignment delivered on January 30, 2024, contained only 475 boxes, resulting in a shortage of 25 boxes.

This shortage has caused significant inconvenience as these items were urgently required for distribution to students for their upcoming technical drawing examinations.

I request you to expedite the delivery of the remaining 25 compass boxes immediately. Alternatively, please adjust the billing amount accordingly.

I look forward to your prompt action in resolving this matter.

Yours sincerely,

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{How does the poet describe the old habit?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: In ``Where the Mind is without Fear,'' Tagore
  describes old habits as ``dead habit'' which ``straitens''

\begin{solutionbox}

\item
  \textbf{Why did the author return to mountains?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: In ``Leopard,'' the author returned to the mountains

  peaceful harmony of the mountain environment.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What was there in place of the store at that spot twenty years
  ago?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: In ``After Twenty Years,'' there was ``Big Joe''

  up with the snow''?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: The phrase ``fill up with snow'' conveys the

  quiet persistence and the gradual covering of all human traces.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{How does the poet describe `heaven of freedom'?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: In ``Where the Mind is Without Fear,'' Tagore

  the woods?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: In ``Stopping by Woods,'' the poet experiences the
  visual sight of ``woods filling up with snow'' and ``frozen lake.''
  The sounds include his horse's ``harness bells'' shaking, ``easy
  wind,'' and the soft landing of ``downy flake'' (snowflakes) -
  creating a contrast between humanity's sounds and nature's quiet.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What kind of man was his friend Jimmy?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: Jimmy Wells was portrayed as honest, principled, and

  showed compassion and personal conflict, revealing his integrity and
  emotional depth.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What happened when the leopard sensed the author's presence?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: When the leopard sensed the author's presence in

  acknowledgment and respect. This moment demonstrated the growing trust
  between human and wild animal.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What kind of characters does the story after twenty years
  have?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: ``After Twenty Years'' features characters who
  represent opposing life paths: Bob (the criminal who achieved material
  success through questionable means) and Jimmy (the honest policeman
  who chose duty and integrity). Their contrast creates the story's
  moral dilemma and ironic ending.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What according to the speaker will surprise the horse?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: In ``Stopping by Woods,'' the speaker suggests the
  horse would be surprised by stopping ``without a farmhouse near'' in
  the dark woods. This unusual pause without practical purpose
  highlights the contrast between animal practicality and human
  appreciation for beauty.
\end{solutionbox}
\item
  \textbf{What is the poet's opinion about the work, idleness, reason
  and old customs?}

\begin{solutionbox}
  \textbf{Answer}: In ``Where the Mind is Without Fear,'' Tagore
  advocates for purposeful work over idleness, valuing reason over blind
  following of outdated customs. He believes clear reason should guide
  actions, not ``dead habit,'' and that meaningful work leads to
  progress toward perfection.
