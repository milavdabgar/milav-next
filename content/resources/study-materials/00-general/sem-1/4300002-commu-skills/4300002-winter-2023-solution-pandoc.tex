  \textbf{What was the author's attitude towards men?}

  who didn't respect the wilderness.

\end{solutionbox}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}

Subject: Complaint Regarding Incomplete Delivery of Compass Boxes

Dear Sir/Madam,

Reference: Purchase Order No. SR/CB/2024/78 dated January 15, 2024

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction regarding the recent delivery of compass boxes ordered by me on January 15, 2024.

As per my purchase order, I had ordered 500 compass boxes, but the consignment delivered on January 30, 2024, contained only 475 boxes, resulting in a shortage of 25 boxes.

This shortage has caused significant inconvenience as these items were urgently required for distribution to students for their upcoming technical drawing examinations.

I request you to expedite the delivery of the remaining 25 compass boxes immediately. Alternatively, please adjust the billing amount accordingly.

I look forward to your prompt action in resolving this matter.

Yours sincerely,

\begin{solutionbox}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \textbf{How does the poet describe the old habit?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``Where the Mind is without Fear,'' Tagore
  describes old habits as ``dead habit'' which ``straitens''
  (narrows/constrains) freedom of thought and action. He sees outdated
  customs and traditions as restricting progress and preventing clear,
  logical thinking needed for a free nation.
\item
  \textbf{Where was the speaker going? What stopped him on the way?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,'' the
  speaker was traveling to fulfill obligations (``promises to keep'').
  The beauty of ``woods filling up with snow'' stopped him momentarily
  on his journey, creating a pause between responsibilities.
\item
  \textbf{What did the stranger say to the policeman?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``After Twenty Years,'' the stranger (Bob) told

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``Leopard,'' the author returned to the mountains
  to escape the chaos of city life, seek solitude in nature, and observe
  wildlife in their natural habitat. He was particularly drawn to the
  peaceful harmony of the mountain environment.
\item
  \textbf{What was there in place of the store at that spot twenty years
  ago?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``After Twenty Years,'' there was ``Big Joe''
  Brady's restaurant at that spot twenty years ago, where Bob and Jimmy
  had their last dinner together before parting ways.
\item
  \textbf{What does the speaker wish to convey through the phrase ``fill
  up with the snow''?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
The phrase ``fill up with snow'' conveys the
  continuous, gentle snowfall creating a sense of completeness,
  stillness, and transformation of the landscape. It suggests nature's
  quiet persistence and the gradual covering of all human traces.
\item
  \textbf{How does the poet describe `heaven of freedom'?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``Where the Mind is Without Fear,'' Tagore
  describes his ``heaven of freedom'' as a place where people hold their
  heads high with dignity, knowledge flows freely, the world isn't
  broken by narrow divisions, words come from truth, reason guides
  action, and thoughts lead to perfection.
\end{enumerate}

\end{solutionbox}

\subsection*{Question 2(b) [4 marks]}\label{q2b}

\textbf{What did Bob tell the man in the overcoat?}

\begin{solutionbox}

the man in the overcoat, unaware he was speaking to a plainclothes

  \textbf{Who does the poet address as `thee' and my father?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``Where the Mind is Without Fear,'' Tagore

  guide his country to true freedom. This spiritual invocation shows his
  belief that achieving his vision requires divine guidance.
\item
  \textbf{What are the sights and sounds that the poet experiences in
  the woods?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``Stopping by Woods,'' the poet experiences the
  visual sight of ``woods filling up with snow'' and ``frozen lake.''
  The sounds include his horse's ``harness bells'' shaking, ``easy
  wind,'' and the soft landing of ``downy flake'' (snowflakes) -
  creating a contrast between humanity's sounds and nature's quiet.
\item
  \textbf{What kind of man was his friend Jimmy?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
Jimmy Wells was portrayed as honest, principled, and
  loyal. He kept his appointment after twenty years, yet chose duty over
  friendship when faced with Bob's criminal status. His note to Bob
  showed compassion and personal conflict, revealing his integrity and
  emotional depth.
\item
  \textbf{What happened when the leopard sensed the author's presence?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
When the leopard sensed the author's presence in
  ``Leopard,'' it paused its drinking, looked directly at the author
  without aggression, and continued its activity, showing mutual
  acknowledgment and respect. This moment demonstrated the growing trust
  between human and wild animal.
\item
  \textbf{What kind of characters does the story after twenty years
  have?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
``After Twenty Years'' features characters who
  represent opposing life paths: Bob (the criminal who achieved material
  success through questionable means) and Jimmy (the honest policeman
  who chose duty and integrity). Their contrast creates the story's
  moral dilemma and ironic ending.
\item
  \textbf{What according to the speaker will surprise the horse?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``Stopping by Woods,'' the speaker suggests the
  horse would be surprised by stopping ``without a farmhouse near'' in
  the dark woods. This unusual pause without practical purpose
  highlights the contrast between animal practicality and human
  appreciation for beauty.
\item
  \textbf{What is the poet's opinion about the work, idleness, reason
  and old customs?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``Where the Mind is Without Fear,'' Tagore
  advocates for purposeful work over idleness, valuing reason over blind
  following of outdated customs. He believes clear reason should guide
  actions, not ``dead habit,'' and that meaningful work leads to
  progress toward perfection.

Subject: Response to Complaint Regarding Curtain Quality

Dear Mr. Mehta,

Reference: Your complaint letter dated January 25, 2024

I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to you regarding the curtains supplied by our company that did not match the quality of the samples shown to you.

At Elegant Interiors, we pride ourselves on maintaining high quality standards, and I regret that we have fallen short of these standards in your case. After investigating the matter, we found that there was an unfortunate mix-up in our inventory, resulting in the dispatch of a different quality material than what was agreed upon.

We understand your disappointment and are committed to resolving this issue promptly. We would like to offer the following solution:

1. We will collect the current curtains from your residence at a time convenient to you.
2. We will replace them with new curtains that match exactly with the samples shown to you, at no additional cost.
3. As a goodwill gesture, we would like to offer a 15% discount on your next purchase from our store.

Our representative will contact you within 48 hours to arrange the collection and replacement. Please feel free to contact me directly at 9876543210 if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Once again, please accept our sincere apologies for this unfortunate situation. We value your business and look forward to serving you better in the future.

Yours sincerely,
