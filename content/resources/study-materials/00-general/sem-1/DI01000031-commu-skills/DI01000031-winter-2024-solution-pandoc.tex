\subsection*{Question 2(B) [8 marks]}\label{q2b}

\textbf{Attempt any two.}

\subsubsection{1. Answer in brief}\label{answer-in-brief}

\textbf{(i) Why did the author return to mountains?}

\begin{solutionbox}
In ``The Leopard,'' the author returned to the
mountains to escape the chaos of city life and find peace in nature. He
was drawn to the solitude and beauty of the mountain environment,
particularly to observe wildlife in their natural habitat. The mountains
offered him a sanctuary where he could connect with nature and
experience the harmony of the wilderness away from human interference.

\textbf{(ii) What did the stranger say to the policeman?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
In ``After Twenty Years,'' the stranger (Bob) told the
policeman that he was waiting for his friend Jimmy Wells, with whom he
had made an appointment twenty years ago to meet at that exact spot. He
explained their friendship from childhood, described how successful he
had become out West, and expressed confidence that Jimmy would honor
their commitment despite the passage of time.

\end{solutionbox}
\subsubsection{2. Answer in brief}\label{answer-in-brief-1}

\textbf{(i) What does the poet say about the owner of the woods?}

\begin{solutionbox}
In ``Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,'' the poet
mentions that the owner of the woods lives in the village and will not
see him stopping there. This suggests the owner is absent, allowing the
speaker to pause and admire the woods privately. The reference
emphasizes the speaker's temporary intrusion into someone else's
property while enjoying a moment of natural beauty.

\textbf{(ii) What are the communication skills?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
Communication skills are abilities that enable
effective exchange of information, ideas, and emotions. These include
verbal skills (speaking and writing clearly), non-verbal skills (body
language, facial expressions), listening skills (active attention and
understanding), and interpersonal skills (empathy, feedback, and
adaptation to different audiences). They are essential for personal and
professional success.

\end{solutionbox}
\subsubsection{3. Answer in brief}\label{answer-in-brief-2}

\textbf{(i) What kind of man was his friend Jimmy?}

\begin{solutionbox}
Jimmy Wells was portrayed as an honest, principled, and
loyal man who became a police officer. He was someone who kept his
promises (meeting Bob after twenty years) but also upheld his
professional duties and moral obligations. Jimmy showed both compassion
and integrity by arranging for another officer to arrest Bob while
explaining his actions through a personal note, demonstrating his
internal conflict between friendship and duty.

\textbf{(ii) What is the basic model of communication?}

\end{solutionbox}
\begin{solutionbox}
The basic model of communication includes five
essential elements: Sender (who creates the message), Message (the
information being communicated), Channel (the medium of transmission),
Receiver (who interprets the message), and Feedback (response confirming
understanding). This linear model shows how information flows from one
person to another, with potential for noise or barriers to interfere
with effective transmission.

\textbf{Attempt any two.}

\subsubsection{1. Write a paragraph on ``Importance of
Trees''}\label{write-a-paragraph-on-importance-of-trees}

\begin{solutionbox}
Trees play a vital role in maintaining ecological
balance and supporting life on Earth. They act as natural air purifiers
by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis,
helping combat air pollution and climate change. Trees prevent soil
erosion, maintain groundwater levels, and provide habitat for countless
species of birds and animals. Economically, they supply timber, fruits,
medicines, and various forest products that sustain human livelihood.
Trees also offer psychological benefits by creating peaceful
environments and reducing stress. Their shade provides natural cooling,
reducing the need for air conditioning and conserving energy. During
monsoons, trees help prevent floods by absorbing excess water. In urban
areas, they improve air quality and enhance the beauty of landscapes.
The presence of trees increases property values and creates pleasant
living spaces. Therefore, protecting existing forests and planting more
trees is essential for environmental sustainability and human survival.

\end{solutionbox}
\subsubsection{2. Write a paragraph on
``Diwali''}\label{write-a-paragraph-on-diwali}

\begin{solutionbox}
Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of
the most significant and widely celebrated festivals in India. This
five-day festival symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good
over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. The celebration commemorates
Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana and completing
fourteen years of exile. People clean and decorate their homes with
colorful rangoli patterns, diyas (oil lamps), and electric lights to
welcome prosperity and happiness. Families gather to perform Lakshmi
Puja, seeking blessings for wealth and prosperity from Goddess Lakshmi.
The festival involves exchanging sweets and gifts with relatives and
friends, strengthening social bonds and relationships. Fireworks and
crackers light up the night sky, creating a spectacular display of
colors and sounds. Traditional sweets like laddu, barfi, and gulab jamun
are prepared and shared with everyone. Markets buzz with activity as
people shop for new clothes, jewelry, and decorative items. Diwali
transcends religious boundaries and brings communities together in
celebration of hope, renewal, and the triumph of positive forces.
