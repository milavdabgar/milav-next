## Purpose & Vision

PlanetMilav is my digital garden where I share knowledge and experiences I find valuable. The site serves as both a personal reference and a resource for others interested in electronics, embedded systems, programming, and data science.

I created this platform with several goals in mind:

1. To document solutions to technical problems I've encountered
2. To share educational resources with students and fellow enthusiasts
3. To track my learning journey across various technical domains
4. To connect with like-minded individuals in the tech community

## Content Focus

As a Lecturer in Electronics and Communication at Government Polytechnic, Palanpur, much of the study material shared here is at the Diploma level. However, I also cover more advanced topics that reflect my personal interests and ongoing education.

The content generally falls into these categories:

| Category | Topics Covered |
|----------|----------------|
| **Electronics** | Circuit design, PCB layout, component selection |
| **Embedded Systems** | Microcontrollers, firmware, real-time systems |
| **Programming** | C/C++, Python, R, and other languages |
| **Data Science** | Machine learning, computer vision, data analysis |
| **IOT** | Sensors, wireless protocols, cloud integration |
| **Academic Resources** | Course materials, project guides, references |
